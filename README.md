# README #

You can use Solidity on any IDE by adding the plugin. I am using Atom and IntelliJ. Mostly Atom for it has syntax check and suggestions too.
Other available IDE/Editors are SublimeText, NetBeans, etc.

### How to compile ###

Using online compilers for it gives better way of passing the amount and checking the transaction hash and the blocks.

* https://ethfiddle.com/ - Easy interface but no way to track the source address and use multiple address to check the authenticity problems.

* https://remix.ethereum.org/#version=soljson-v0.4.19+commit.c4cbbb05.js - Hard interface but with variable features.


### What is this repository for? ###

* Take a look at basic code and understand the syntax and methods.
* Contribute sample codes for others to understand.
* Build the first sample application.


### How do I deploy in Production? ###

You will need a distributed network. I tried one thing with test-net. Researching more on it, will keep it updating.
